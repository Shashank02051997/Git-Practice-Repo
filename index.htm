<h2 class="h22">C PROGRAMMING</h2>
<p class="p1">C is a computer programming language. That means that you can use C 
to create lists of instructions for a computer to follow. C was originally developed by 
Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs. It has since become one of the most 
widely used programming languages of all time, with C compilers from various vendors 
available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems.
C is a high-level and general purpose programming language that is ideal for developing 
firmware or portable applications. The C program is the human-readable form, while 
the executable that comes out of the compiler is the machine-readable and executable 
form. It has fixed number of keywords, including a set of control primitives, such as if, 
for, while, switch and do while.

<h2 class="h23">C++ PROGRAMMING</h2>
<p class="p2">C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by 
many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the 
C language. C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented 
and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory 
manipulation. C++ is an object oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by 
Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of C language. The main highlight of C++ is a 
collection of pre-defined classes, which are data types that can be instantiated multiple 
times. The main highlight of C++ is a collection of pre-defined classes, which are data types 
that can be instantiated multiple times. The language also facilitates declaration of 
user defined classes. In 1983, C with Classes was renamed to C++ ("++" being the 
increment operator in C), adding new features that included virtual functions, function 
name and operator overloading, references, constants, type-safe free-store memory 
allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments 
with two forward slashes (//).

<h2 class="h24">JAVA PROGRAMMING</h2>
<p class="p3">Java is a programming language expressly designed for use in the distributed 
environment of the Internet. It is a programming language and computing platform first 
released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is intended to let application developers "write 
once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms 
that support Java without the need for recompilation. It was designed to have the "look 
and feel" of the C++ language, but it is simpler to use than C++ and enforces an 
object-oriented programming model. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming 
languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications. Java is object-oriented, 
which means that, among other characteristics, an object can take advantage of being 
part of a class of objects and inherit code that is common to the class. There are lots of 
applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more 
are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters,
 game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is 
everywhere!

<h2 class="h25">DATA STRUCTURE</h2>
<p class="p4">A data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data.
 Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be 
accessed and worked with in appropriate ways. General data structure types include the
 array, the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on. In computer programming, a 
data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of working on it 
with various algorithms.
